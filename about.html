                <p>Hi! My name is Okunola Marcus, CEO of Mechus. There are two master problems Mechus wants to solve:</p>

                <h1>Problem 1: The problem of a tech owner.</h2>
                <h1>Problem 2: The problem of a tech engineer.</h2>
                
                <p>Acquiring a tech is easy. Managing a tech is somewhere in the middle.
                 <strong>Repairing a tech is difficult.</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li> Do you have a pile of laptops, phones, and other gadgets that has been lying dormant in your home ?</li>
                    
                    <li>Have you ever gone through sweat and blood to fix your car, phone, or any other gadgets?</li>
                    
                    <li> Do you have a spoilt car that has been lying in your garage for years?</li>
                    
                    <li> Ever got stuck on the highway for 2 hours before you get a mechanic?</li>
                    
                    <li> What about those other gadgets that litter your home, feeling they are impossible to repair due to their sophistication</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <p>We want to repair your tech. We want to alleviate the stress you face in repairing them. Don’t stress any more. Sit in your couch, grab a soft drink, pick up your phone, and order for a Mechus engineer that will attend to you in minutes.( It is that simple.) We try our best to go diverse; meaning we fix virtually any tech (apart from aeroplanes obviously).</p>
                
                <p>Visit our website or download our application to get started.</p>
                
                <p>The engineers are screaming:”hey what about the problems you promised to solve for us ?”
